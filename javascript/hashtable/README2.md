## Approach & Efficiency

### Approach

1. I understood the problem first.
1. I imagined how the results should be.
1. I wrote the algorithm.
1. I wrote the code.
1. I made the tests.

### Efficiency

- Space :
  - O(n)
- Time :
  - O(n^2)

## API

### How to Use

- To check for first repeated word in a string :
  - `<name-of-hash-map>.repeatedWord(<string>)`

### Test

- `npm run test`
